My Ml Projects

knn folder has a project in which I took a large dataset and then implemented knn from scratch and used tkinter for GUI, so user can select files, and enter query points and run the algorithm, and display result on canvas. You can use your dataset the only thing is you've to keep the path of the datasets in a file and open that file from file explorer.
